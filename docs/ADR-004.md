# ADR-003: Choice of Persistence Technology and Repositories

## Context

It was necessary to implement a persistence layer that allowed efficient storage and retrieval
of ticket-related data, maintaining a clear separation of concerns and complying with the
project's hexagonal architecture.

A solution was sought that:

- Allowed easy mapping of relational tables to domain objects.
- Simplified common operations such as saving, updating, or querying by attributes.
- Was compatible with a robust and widely used relational database.

Additionally, the architecture required separating domain repositories from infrastructure,
allowing the data access logic to be decoupled from the rest of the system.

## Decision

For data persistence, SQL Server was chosen as the database engine.  
It is used through a Docker image, facilitating the development and testing environment.  
The application connects to this database using the address `host.docker.internal` so that the
backend container can access the database running in another container.

Regarding data access and mapping, JPA (Java Persistence API) was chosen as the ORM technology.  
This decision was made because JPA allows mapping relational tables to Java classes easily, facilitating operations such as saving, querying, and searching data with predefined methods, thus reducing the need to write SQL manually.

Additionally, a domain repository (`TicketRepository`) was created, and an adapter class (`TicketRepositoryImpl`) was implemented that internally uses a Spring Data JPA repository (`TicketJPARepository`).

## Implementation Details

There are repository implementations that allow returning domain objects to upper layers.

The structure used is as follows:

### Domain Repository
```java

public interface TicketRepository {
    List<Ticket> findAll();
    Ticket findById(Long id);
    Ticket save(Ticket ticket);
}
```

### Spring Data JPA Repository

```java

public interface TicketJPARepository extends JpaRepository<TicketEntity, Long> {
}
```

### Repository adapter

```java
@Repository
@RequiredArgsConstructor
public class TicketRepositoryImpl implements TicketRepository {

    private final TicketJPARepository ticketJpaRepository;

    @Override
    public List<Ticket> findAll() {
        return ticketJpaRepository.findAll().stream().map(TicketMapper::toModel).toList();
    }

    @Override
    public Ticket findById(Long id) {
        return ticketJpaRepository.findById(id)
                .map(TicketMapper::toModel)
                .orElseThrow(() -> new TicketNotFoundException("No ticket with id " + id));
    }

    @Override
    public Ticket save(Ticket ticket) {
        TicketEntity ticketEntity = TicketMapper.toEntity(ticket);
        return Optional.of(TicketMapper.toModel(ticketJpaRepository.save(ticketEntity)))
                .orElseThrow(() -> new RuntimeException("An error occurred while saving the ticket"));
    }
}

```
