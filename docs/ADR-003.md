# ADR-003: Centralized Exception Handling with ControllerAdvice

## Context
During the development of the project, the need was identified to clearly handle exceptions
that may arise in HTTP requests to avoid generic and uninformative responses, as well as to
control the logs generated by the application when an exception is thrown.

## Decision
It was decided to implement a global exception handler using `@ControllerAdvice` in Spring Boot,
which captures specific exceptions (such as `TicketNotFoundException`) and general ones,
returning HTTP responses with appropriate codes (404, 500) along with a body that reports the
message, path, status, and date/time of the error.

## Consequences
- Allows clearer and more uniform error handling in the API.
- Improves client experience by providing more informative responses.
- Requires monitoring for new exceptions that may arise to add their handling in the controller.
- Reduces noise in server logs by controlling expected exceptions.

## Discarded Alternatives
- Not handling exceptions globally and letting Spring respond with generic errors.
- Handling exceptions in each individual controller, which would increase duplication and 
complicate maintenance.
