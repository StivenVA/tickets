# ADR 001 - Choice of Backend Language and Framework

## Context

For the development of the application's backend, a language and framework were needed that would allow building RESTful services, with good support for database integration and ease of implementing clean or hexagonal architecture.

## Decision

Java was chosen as the programming language and Spring Boot as the main backend framework.

## Justification

- Java is a mature language with wide adoption in the industry.
- Spring Boot enables rapid configuration and offers a large number of ready-to-use features.
- Good support for integration with SQL Server databases, which was the chosen database engine.
- Allows implementing clean and layered architectures, which was a project requirement.
- Previous experience with Java and Spring facilitated adoption.

## Consequences

- The project benefited from a robust and scalable architecture.
- A clear separation of responsibilities was achieved by following design patterns and hexagonal architecture.
