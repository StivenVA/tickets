# ADR 002 - Use of Hexagonal Architecture

## Context

An architecture is needed that allows for project maintainability, and also facilitates a clear
separation of responsibilities and reduces coupling between components. Additionally, the goal is to use an architectural pattern with which there is experience to ensure its correct implementation more efficiently.

## Decision

It was decided to use Hexagonal Architecture (also known as Ports and Adapters) to structure
the project. This architecture allows for well-separated layers, where the business logic (domain) is isolated from infrastructure and presentation details.

## Justification

- Allows for high cohesion and low coupling between the different layers of the system.
- Facilitates project maintenance and scalability.
- The domain layer remains completely independent of external details, which improves
- the robustness and testability of the business core.

## Consequences

- Each layer is clearly defined, facilitating code organization.
- The domain layer does not depend on any external entity or component.
- Care must be taken to properly define the interfaces (ports) and adapters to maintain
this separation.
