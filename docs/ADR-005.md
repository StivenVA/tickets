# ADR-004: Organization of Controllers and Services

## Context

The project does not require managing a large number of entities, as it only works with `Ticket`
and `UnresolvedTicket`.  
Since these entities are directly related and there are few endpoints, the intention is to
simplify the controller structure (at least for this specific case).

## Decision

- Centralize all endpoints in a single controller.
- Separate business logic into different services, one of them specialized in managing 
unresolved tickets.  
This approach facilitates future implementation if another controller is desired to handle
the service calls for unresolved tickets.

## Consequences

- The design remains simple and straightforward, given the project's size and scope.
- The overhead of unnecessary classes and structures is reduced.
- Business logic remains organized in well-defined services, maintaining separation of concerns.
